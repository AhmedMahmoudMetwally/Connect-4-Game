#Game Description :
Connect 4 is a two-player game in which the players first choose a color and then take turns 
dropping their colored discs from the top into a grid. 
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column.
The objective of the game is to connect-four of oneâ€™s own discs of the same color next to each other vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. 
The two players keep playing until the board is full. The winner is the player having greater number of connected-fours.

#Algorithms You are required to support the following 2 algorithms as options for the AI agent: 

â€¢ Minimax without alpha-beta pruning 

â€¢ Minimax with alpha-beta pruning
